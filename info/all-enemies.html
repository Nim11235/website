		TL;DR: Kill all enemies (except a couple outlined below).

		What defines an enemy in this case: An enemy is an NPC in the game that will become hostile/attack you when you approach (walk up to it, and be in physical contact with). For some configuration of your character to the enemy, as you approach, if they aggro, they are an enemy. This excludes NPC's that become hostile as the result of a questline (horace, leohnard, sirris, etc) Also, NPC's must also be targetable, i.e. you can use the in game targeting mechanic on them without making them hostile. The targetable feature is the defining feature; This is a disjunctive property of an NPC used to define an enemy: If it can be targeted without being provoked, it is an enemy.

		This document outlines the rules for the "All Enemies" category of DS3 runs. This run is meant to force players to face every possible difficulty in the game, rather than running/sneaking by as much as possible to get through it quickly. Here; targetable enemy refers to anything that can be targeted without provocation. This includes passive enemies that are targetable, but not passive NPCs, which can only be targeted upon provocation. However, mimics must be killed, even though they must be provoked (because I'm an asshole).	Enemies must also be approachable: Meaning you can walk up to them (being near, does not count as a provocation). This description is meant to help understand what enemies need to be killed (only	a few early ones get exempted due to a technicality) without having to list them all out (I'm lazy). 

		<h2>General Rules</h2> 
		<ol>
			<li>The enemies which must be killed are those which are targetable without provocation. The exceptions are baby crystal lizards in a loaded area, and the smouldering flesh in the lava in the demon ruins (requires a bow/magic to be consistent). If you decide to allow  bows for your run, the Smouldering Flesh in the lava must be killed.</li>
			<li>Any class may be chosen, as well as any burial gift.</li>
			<li>Bonfires may only be used once their corresponding previous area has been cleared of all enemies. See Bonfire Section for Details.</li>
			<li>
				Areas must be done in "order:"
				<ol>
					<li>Graves</li>
					<li>Highwall</li>
					<li>Settlement </li>
					<li>Road of Sacrifices</li>
					<li>Sage+cathedral</li>
					<li>Poison Swamp</li>
					<li>Catacombs</li>
					<li>Demon Ruins</li>
					<li>Irithyll</li>
					<li>Either Dungeon or Anor Londo first, but If Pontiff is done before dungeon, Aldrich must follow</li>
					<li>Untended Graves</li>
					<li>Lothric Castle</li>
					<li>Grand Archives</li>
					<li>Cinder/Nameless</li>
					<li>Ashes of Ariandel</li>
					<li>Ringed City</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>Bonfires may be used multiple times; However, any enemies killed in a section that wasn't fully cleared, must be rekilled.</li>
			<li>Sections must be contiguous; This means you cannot "start" a section to get an item, and start another area. Homeward bones are not banned, but if the section was not cleared, then it must be fully recleared.</li>
			<li>You may activate a bonfire (but not use it) before it's been unlocked to allow easier travel.</li>
			<li>Summons are prohibited.</li>
			<li>If you accidentally rest at a bonfire, and forget any enemy in that section, you must reclear the whole area.</li>
			<li>Saving and quitting is allowed ONLY after resting at new bonfire, teleporting back to Firelink and satisfying the requirements of resting at said bonfire, and have no aggroed NPCs in Firelink.</li>
			<li>If you are invaded, you must defeat the invasion. Online is not required, but any NPC that invades you must be defeated. You cannot despawn it and return later. However, if the invasion is avoided, you do not need to trigger the invasion. Note that steam-offline mode cannot be utilized for this; NPC invasions must be able to occur.</li>
			<li>Crystal Lizards are not required to be killed (They despawn and do not attack you). Ravenous Lizards must be  killed.</li>
			<li>Friendly NPC's do not need to be killed, but can be as necessary, as long as you follow the rules in w/e category you are going for (e.g. deathless or hitless).</li>
			<li>No Glitches allowed</li>
			<li>The enemies in the Ancient Wyvern arena must be killed before killing the wyvern.</li>
			<li>In Ringed City Swamp; The smaller locusts either need to be killed or chased until they bury themselves and cannot be found. They become untargetable unless provoked at this point. This also handles the issue if they bury themselves, and cannot be found for whatever reason.</li>
			<li>Side quests do not need to be done.</li>
			<li>Cathedral Graveyard: Due to enemies respawning (sometimes infinitely), and due to the inconsistency with with verifying infinite respawns, the enemies that need to be killed are the maggot-exposed zombies (those zombies which have maggot creatures protruding from their bodies).</li>
			<li>
				General Enemies that must be killed, even when aforementionedly excluded: 
				<ul>
					<li>DLC Invasions</li>
					<li>Mimics</li>
					<li>Shira</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				General Notes about special cases:
				<ul>
					<li>Highwall wyvern cannot be targeted at all, it also can only be killed with sufficentially high damage.</li>
					<li>Highwall wyvern event relocates, but can be made to relocate earlier with a bow (drops 1 LTS)</li>
					<li>Highwall Darkwraith is not missable, leonhard drops the key.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
